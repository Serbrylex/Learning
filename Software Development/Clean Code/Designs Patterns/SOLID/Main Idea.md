SOLID is an acronym used to describe the design patterns for OOP

- [[Single responsibility principle]] (SRP)
- [[Open-closed principle]] (OCP)
- [[Liskov substitution principle]] (LSP)
- [[Interface segregation principle]] (ISP)
- [[Dependency inversion principle]] (DIP)

SOLID arises as a good practice and as a design principle to make the OOP easy to read, scalable and more maintainable.

This principles are language agnostic and have a high level of abstraction.

Despite being born out of problems of the OOP world, SOLID principles have their application beyond it. Making the code more maintainable and robust. We should learn to recognize when further decomposition or decoupling of components stands to introduce complexity for little to no benefit.
