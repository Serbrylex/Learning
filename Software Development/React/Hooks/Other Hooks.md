These hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren't commonly used in the application code.

- [[useDebugValue]] lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom hook.
- [[useId]] lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
- [[useSyncExternalStore]] lets a component subscribe to an external store.
